At first the govern want to stop intelligence work aft the war, but three major reason made high official decide against this action. The first was the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Dulles made it clear that the main reason fro the surprise element was not that the unite state did not have information about Japanese intention, but that the information avail was not coordinate and submitted to proper authority. The Army, Navy and the F. B. I. did have a lot of information on the forthcoming Japanese attack, but fortunate, this information never went beyond these source. Thus, the defense force of the Nation were never alert for an attack and the President did not know of it until aft the aster. The second reason was that the unite state face a great deal of disillusion with the Russian at the Yalta Conference aft which they broke almost all of their promise on such the a the occupation of Berlin and the western orient country such a Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. It was not until 1947 and the Truman Doctrine which Dulles call \" the year of the awaken a to what Communism meant. \" Dulles felt that the Truman Doctrine was not enough to stop the tide of Communism. Although the unite state was invite by the govern of Greece to help in the fight against the Communist guerrilla, it was helpless to fight the communist in a country in which it service were not invite.

Tee Difficult... Tee Spread Mr. Dulles made it clear that the C. I. A. was not the on organization found for the protection of unite state security. The National Defense Act of 1947 set up the National Security Council and the formalize of the Defense Department. Yet in order for the unite state to be able to protect herself beyond h shore the C. I. A. had to be set up because a Dulles said: \" Our problem have gotten to difficult and spread out... and thus the C. I. A. would be able to set up security force in Vietnam and Cuba. \" In help to formulate policy Dulles gave four major mode in which the C. I. A. must work.
