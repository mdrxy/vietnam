@TITLE=SDS To Sponsor Socialist Speaker
@BODY=ON Wednesday, February 26, at 7:30 in the Main Lounge of the Moulton Union, Bowdoin College, the SDS and the Young Socialist Alliance will jointly sponsor an informal lecture and discussion with Stuart Singer, a member of the Boston Young Socialist Alliance. Stuart Singer together with 12 other members of the YSA, representing chapters all over the country, were invited to spend a month in Cuba by the Cuban Government and participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of Cuba. In addition to an extensive tour of the island, there was a meeting between the YSA members and the representative to Cuba of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They discussed the course of the war and the anti-war movement in the United Stated. In particular they discussed the GI Civilian Anti-War demonstration to be in New York and five other cities on April 6. The NLF spokesmen made it clear that in spite of the Paris talks, the Vietnamese will accept only the complete withdrawal of U.S troops from Vietnam. Singer will tour high schools and colleges throughout New England speaking about the Cuban revolution and building support for the April 6 anti-war demonstration.
