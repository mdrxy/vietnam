@TITLE=HAWKS OBJECTIVE 
@BODY=To the Editor:
Frederick Deamant, in a letter published Oct.
22, states he has been unable to find out what it
is that the doves want for Vietnam.
I can't help him by speaking with authority
about the objectives of all the breeds of doves.
But I hope that he can help me with one of my
worries about the hawks, whose objectives he
has "no difficulty in understanding."
Consider the two leading objectives of the
hawks, as they are listed by Mr, Deamant: they
don't want Communism to spread; they want
South Vietnam to have a freeâ€žchoice of government.
There is a high probability that these
two aims are mutually contradictory.
President Eisenhower estimated that if elections
had been held in 1956, in accordance with
the Geneva agreement, the vote would have gone
80 per cent for union of North and South under
Ho Chi Minh. And in the recent elections, rigged
although they were, almost two-thirds of those
v/ho were permitted to vote cast their ballots
for candidates committed to seek accommodation
with the Vietcong.
Thus if all South Vietnamese get a chance to
express their wishes, a good majority will be likely
to choose a government which the hawks will
regard as pure Communism. And what will the
hawks (who, says Mr. Deamant, do concern
themselves with consequences) do then?
I have posed this question several times, to
politicians and to representatives of the State Department,
who have always evaded it. Perhaps
Mr. Deamant can enlighten me.
