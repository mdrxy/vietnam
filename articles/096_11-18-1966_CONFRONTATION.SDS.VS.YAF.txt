@TITLE=Confrontation: SDS vs YAF
@BODY=For many campus zanies, 10:30 PM Wednesday was Union break but to a few fervent souls an hour of unrest and action. About 20 students (a fantastic turnout by Bowdoin standards) gathered in Conference Room B under the egis of Marc Freedman's new answer to Bowdoin boredom - Students for a Democratic Society. The meeting was called both to assess student interest and to organize a protest against the Selective Service College Qualification Test being given on Saturday. Not only was interest and concern shown in discussion of such topics as Vietnam, Black Power, and the Draft, by serious supporters of the SDS cause but equal if not greater contributions were made by a contingent of right wing conservatives and sympathizers who were present as interested observers. What otherwise might have been a run of the mill meeting became a lively affair full of interesting discussion and hard thinking. The next meeting is scheduled for next week at the same time. Whatever may become of this group's plans to bring controversial speakers to Bowdoin in order to stimulate discussion of contemporary problems and public issue one can only hope that they are successful and that this spark of activism will light off future fire of action.
