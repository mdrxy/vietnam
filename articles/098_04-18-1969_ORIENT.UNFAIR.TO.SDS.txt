@TITLE=ORIENT Unfair to SDS
@BODY=To the Editor:â€¨I would like to correct a few of your misreadings (Editorial, April 4) of the ROTC pamphlet and to criticize your shoddy and un-analytical criticisms: 1.) The question presented in the pamphlet has nothing to do with a cops and robbers or good guys and bad guys view. It is based on the analysis of who has power in the society, the nature of that power, and how that power is used in the world and at home. ROTC plays a key role in maintaining and expanding that power of a certain class of people in America. Thus the catalogue of events from Vietnam to Detroit to Chicago to Newport News, Va. are evidence of the oppressive use of that power. In practice this means the slaughter of Vietnamese and black people and the crushing of workers' strikes and student 
movements. This is why ROTC must be opposed. 2.) Your editorial in a very easy and mindless way sloughs off this analysis. It brands the pamphlet with names such as cops and robbers. Yet if conveniently forgets to deal with the analysis in any way. It is your- duty in order to criticize this pamphlet to present a complete view in which you present your ideas on the crushing of Vietnam, the exploitation and oppression of black people, and the use of troops from the Dominican Republic to the University of Wisconsin to an oil workers' strike in Texas.
