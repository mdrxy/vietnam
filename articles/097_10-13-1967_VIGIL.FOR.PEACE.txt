@TITLE=VIGIL FOR PEACE
@BODY=Will you be at the vigil on the mall this Sunday at noon,
or will you wait until your own father/brother/son/cousin/best
friend becomes a casualty of the war in Vietnam. More horrifying
than the war itself is the lack of conscience of the
American people. If you feel any' sense of disgust, horror, or
sorrow at the senseless and spiraling slaughter of human life in
Vietnam, then you must go to the peace vigil Sunday. Every
day brings more casualties and less hope of an end to this futile
massacre. RFS
