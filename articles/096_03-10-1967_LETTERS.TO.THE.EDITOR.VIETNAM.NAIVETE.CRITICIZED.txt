@TITLE=LETTER TO THE EDITOR VIETNAM NAIVETE CRITICIZED
@BODY=To The Editor:Howard E. Marston's letter concerning the warin Vietnam displayed all the political sophisticationof a three year old child. I would like to believethat his oversimplistic analysis of the' situationwas intended to be satiric; it is indeed Ironicthat he calls American soldiers "naive".The first of his contentions, that General Ky andhis staff are "all traitors and tories", is ratherdifficult to comprehend -but then that places itwell within the logical structure of his letter. Itwould appear that Mr. Marston's knowledge ofVietnam is culled from a cursory examination ofcomic books.An interesting point which he makes is that "ifpeace came tomorrow, our whole economy wouldcollapse." His answer to this problem is to transferthe defense budget to humanitarian projects.A laudable aim, but slightly impractical 'if hereally believes "that all our prosperity since 1929has been due to war spending." Mr Marston isentirely correct when he says that he has a "simplesolution" to the war.It is unfortunate that both sides, the supportersand the critics, are represented in print by obviouslyuninformed people. I make no pretensetoward understanding all the complications of thewar in Vietnam. But I do believe that any discussionshould be based upon a minimal amount ofknowledge. Mr. Marston is willing to spend 73billion dollars on "feeding, housing and clothingthe poor of the world . . .", how much is he willingto spend on his own education?Jeff Douglas Emerson '70
