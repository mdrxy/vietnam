@TITLE=Military's Credibility Prompts Controversy
@BODY=There are few institutions in ing Corps) on campus.America today more irrationallydenounced and more unintelligentlydefended that the United Statesmilitary. The anxiety concerningthe war in Vietnam and the bitternesscreated by an oft-consideredinequitable system of conscriptionhave prompted a severe examinationof military affairs in Americaby educational, religious, andpolitical leaders. Many who resentsuch an examination, however,claim the legitimate object of investigationshould be the institutionto which the military is sub7ordinate, namely the federal government.The examination, nevertheless,continues, and perhaps nowheredoes the military receive as intensea critical evaluation as itdoes at colleges and universities.At Bowdoin, the thrust of thisprocess of evaluation appears to beless motivated by the war in Vietnamor the draft as it is by certainpractical and educational issuessurrounding the presence of ROTC (Reserve Officers' Train-Controversy Is Academic CreditCertainly the most controversialissue at Bowdoin concerningROTC is the granting of academiccredit for courses in military science.Bowdoin presently awardstwo academic credits for ROTCcourses, one semester of which istaken in the junior year, the otherin the senior year. There is a feelingamong some faculty membersand students that the intellectualcontent of military science coursesis inconsistent with the traditionalobjectives of the liberal arts college.Furthermore, there is concernfor a possible restriction of aROTC undergraduate's personalfreedom because of his associationwith the United States Army.Practical and ProfitableFrom a standpoint considerablymore favorable to ROTC than thatsuggested above, many feel it isthe College's duty to provide itsstudents with a practical andprofitable way of fulfilling theirpotential military obligation.ROTC, they feel, is currently themost sensible way for Bowdoin to 
meet that duty. There is, finally,the argument that ROTC guaranteesthat the country's militaryforce will not be composed entirelyof purely professional soldiers,but by officers who have beenexposed to a wide range of nonmilitaryaffairs.Given the essential issues concerningthe military at Bowdoin,what follows here is for the mostpart an analysis of where ROTCstands in the eyes of several membersof the faculty and studentbody. It is not an exhaustivestudy, nor does it attempt in anyway to reflect the sentiments ofthe faculty or student factions asa whole regarding these issues.* * *ROTC at Bowdoin is currently adepartment containing five officersof instruction and 112 participatingundergraduates, 23 ofwhom are seniors. 24 studentshere are receiving ROTC Scholarshipsfrom the Department of theArmy providing tuition, books,supplies and retainer pay.Yearly ContractBowdoin is involved in theROTC program under terms of acontract from the federal governmentwhich is renewed annually.Appointments to the Military ScienceDepartment are made by theDepartment of the Army, but mustbe finally approved by the College.The College, furthermore,owns Rhodes Hall, the headquartersfor the ROTC Department.Divided Into Two CoursesThe ROTC program is dividedinto two courses, the Basic Courseduring the first two years, forwhich no academic credit is given,and the Advance Course in the finaltwo years, for which the CollegeGrants two academic credits.Course offerings in the first twoyears include Army organization,markmanship, map and aerialphotograph reading, military , tactics,leadership, and Americanmilitary history. Freshman spendone hour a week in the ROTCclassroom with an additional 30hours per year in drill instruction.Sophomores have two hours ofclass a week and 30 hours drill ayear.In the Advanced Course duringthe third and fourth years, suchcourses as military training principles,small unit tactics and communications,military law, andArmy administration are given.Juniors and Seniors spend fourhours a week in the classroom,and 30 hours a year in drill. Inthe summer between a cadet'sthird and fourth year he attendsa six weeks' summer camp at anArmy installation, for which he ispaid $220. In the Advanced Coursea cadet is paid $50 a month. Oncompletion of the four year program,the cadet is commissionedas a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army.
Bowdoin Gives LittleCredit PercentagewiseBowdoin is not alone5in givingacademic credit for ROTCcourses, but as the chart below illustrates,the percentage of academiccredit given for ROTCcourses at Bowdoin, consideringthe total number of credits requiredto graduate, is comparatively low. 
Faculty ScrutinyThe overall position of ROTCat Bowdoin receives careful scrutinyeach year by faculty committees.The Faculty Committeeon Military Affairs, headed byProfessor Burton Taylor of theSociology Department, has beenmeeting once a week since theacademic year began. Prof. Taylortermed the work of the Committee"exploratory" and notedthat all issues relative the ROTC,including whether or not to getrid of it at Bowdoin and the problemof academic credits are beingconsidered. The Committeewill issue its report in January.The Committee on Curriculum andEducational Planning has alsodealt with ROTC in the past.Recent Council MotionConcern for ROTC at Bowdoinhas been brewing for severalyears now, and its most recentmanifestation occurred at lastMonday's Student Council meeting.Representative John Whipple'68 introduced a resolution callingfor the abolition of all academiccredit for ROTC courses. The motion,which will be sent next week
to Dean Greason, Chairman of theRecording Committee, was passed20 to four.President Peter Hayes '68 observed,however, that it was theCouncil's opinion that the majorityof students here believe ROTCshould continue at Bowdoin, butwithout academic credit.Mitchell Wants ROTC OutLast year one of ROTC's mostoutspoken critics, Assistant ProfessorBarry Mitchell of the MathematicsDepartment, presented arecommendation to the faculty advocatingthe general phasing-outof ROTC, to be completed by 1970.The motion, which was referredto the Committee on Curriculumand Educational Policy, was defeated,but Mitchell noted that35% of the faculty voted for hismotion. In presenting its arguments,the Committee maintainedthat the ROTC program justifieditself enough to be continued andthat the situation at the Collegewas then not conducive to anyradical revision.Prof. Mitchell, however, has remainedcritical of ROTC at Bowdoin,especially concerning the issueof academic credit. "Thecourses are well-known to be of atrivial nature, and there is certainlynothing very challengingAbout them."
Intellectual Value ofROTC QuestionedHe finds invalid the argumentthat ROTC, because it is completelyoptional, should not becriticized. "That argument," hesays, "would justify almost anythingon campus." That ROTCserves a necessary function* atBowdoin given the present militarysituation in America, he alsoconsiders fallacious. "We are hereto criticize the intellectual valueof ROTC and the fact that this isAmerica and that's the way thingsare is really no argument. Onecan accept the fact that we haveto have an army, but there is aquestion as to whether or not thisis a function of the universitiessince military and intellectualvalues are almost invariably contradictory."Indoctrination And AnIntellectual FrontProf. Mitchell claimed, furthermore,that students learn littlefrom ROTC courses. "Any ROTCcourse is essentially a course inindoctrination — it has to be bythe nature of the military, by thenature of war. Whereas whatevery other professor at the Collegeshould try to do is exactlythe opposite — one shouldn't beindoctrinated, one should question*everything.""My way of looking at it," heConcluded, "is. that the militaryuses the College 'to give it (themilitary) an intellectual frontwhich is just not there." Mitchellalso said he would want ROTCout of Bowdoin even if academic
credit were done away with, sincethe ROTC Department would stillbe trading falsely on Bowdoin'sintellectual reputation.Hannaford's Three PointsProfessor Reginald Hannafordof the English Department, whovoted for Prof. Mitchell's motionlast year, raised three questionsrelevant to" the position of ROTCat Bowdoin."First, there is a serious questionas to whether or not the instructionin military science canhave the academic rigor, researchorientation, and liberal arts focus

College have to express their concernFor what is happening there.As such the ROTC program represents an undesirable stifling ofone of the important functions ofthe college experience: free inquiryand discussion."ROTC Not Completely OptionalProf. Hannaford also chargedthat ROTC at Bowdoin is not completelyoptional. A truly optionalsituation would exist only when alternativeservice occupations atthe College level were given thesame financial and professionalsupport that is given to ROTC. Inthis respect he mentioned specificallythe Pineland Project andother possible social service activities.Fleming WorriedAbout MisconceptionsHead" of the Bowdoin ROTC Departmentis Lieutenant ColonelRichard S. Fleming, a graduateof the University of Pennsylvania,and a veteran of five major campaignsin the European Theaterwith the 36th Infantry Divisionduring the World War II. He wasawarded the Bronze Star Medalfor Valor with Oak Leaf Clusterand two Purple Hearts. Prior tocoming to Bowdoin in 1962, Col.Fleming had served in Germanyand Korea.Col. Fleming expressed his concernover what he termed an "artificialbarrier" between Bowdoin students and their ROTC Department. 
In particular he spokeof misconceptions regarding thepersonal freedom of a member ofthe. U.S. Army, held by many atBowdoin and elsewhere." How littlethe American public reallyknows about its military establishmentis astounding. In this context,he believes one of ROTC'schief functions is "to provide interactionbetween the academicworld and the military establishment,to clear the air and removesuspicion."ROTC Does NotImpair Personal FreedomThe idea that a member of theBowdoin ROTC Department is inany way restricted in expressingdissension regarding the war inVietnam is puzzling to Col. Fleming.As for restrictions or instructions for ROTC members concerningthe march on the PentagonOn October 20, he "replied: "IGave them none. I didn't even discussit with them." He saidthat no punitive action would havebeen taken against any BowdoinROTC student who participated inthe Washington march.No Statement Preventing DissentCol. Fleming declared that theclaim made in recent letter to theEditor of the Orient that all ROTCstudents must sign a pledge preventingthem from taking part inanti-Administration demonstrationsis completely false. A thirdyear student in the ROTC programmust sign only the following statement:I ... do hereby acknowledgeto have voluntarily enlisted,under the conditions prescribedby law, this . . . day of . . .,19 ... in the .. . for a periodof . . . years unless sooner dischargedby proper authority; andI do solemnly swear that I willsupport and defend the Constitutionof the United States againstall enemies, foreign and domestic;that I will bear true faith" and allegiance to the same; and that I 
Will obey the orders of the President of 
United States and theorders of the officers appointedover me, according to regulations,and the Uniform Code of Militaryjustice. So help me God.Army Of College GraduatesSpeaking of the advantages ofROTC to the country, Col. Flemingnoted that "as long as we getofficers from liberal arts colleges,there is far less danger of a militarytake-over." He also said thatthe latest promotion list to Generalincluded a greater numberof ROTC graduates than WestPoint graduates.The issue of academic credit hefeels is one which must be handledby the College. Col. Flemingnoted the degree to which Bowdoinplays a part in determiningROTC policy, particularly when astudent in the Advanced Coursewishes to leave the program. Sucha request is acted upon entirelywithin the College by a panel of
Military and academic personnel. 
The undergraduate leader of ROTC here is Cadet Lieutenant Colonel Jim Georgeitis '68. A premed student Georgitis didn't join ROTC until after his sophomore year, making up his prerequisites in summer camp. He feels that the ROTC courses are not in general intellectually stimulating, but their value lies in the practical application after commission. Georgitis is also not opposed to abolishing academic credit, feeling that such a move would not drastically upset the present course offerings. 
"I see ROTC as an opportunity for the Bowddoin student to fulfill an obligation arbitrarily set up by an outside force, namely the country of which he is a citizen. The draft may be inequitable, but at least ROTC at Bowdoin gives the student a choice to determine the type of service he wishes." 
No Chance ForSubversion — PettitCadet Major Mark Pettit '68 isa four-year ROTC student whotentatively plans on law schoolnext year. Pettit believes that theliberal arts education at Bowdoinenables a student to reconcile hismilitary training with his academicwork."Although the military sciencecurriculum may in some ways bedistinct from the rest of the Bowdoincurriculum, I don't think thatit is necessarily antagonistic to it.A liberal arts education with itsbroad base of interest will not besubverted by the study-of militaryinformation, even though themethod of study is of necessityless analytical than that of mostBowdoin courses."As for abolishing ROTC; -he expressedconcern about the effectof such action on the student."You are approaching a largerquestion incorrectly by taking alternativesaway from the student.Military obligation  is a fact oflife, and you are going to harmthe student by limiting his. choiceof the fulfillment of this obligationbefore eliminating the obligationitself. A Bowdoin student entersROTC without any militarybackground and must thereforeaccept certain basic informationon faith just as in any disciplinewhether intellectual or practical."
