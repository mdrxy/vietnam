@TITLE=If You're Planning on Joining ROTC
@BODY=If you're planning on joining ROTC, if you have a low draft number and don't plan to fight it or to flee to Canada, or even if you're opposed to the war but are not quite certain exactly why you're opposed, I suggest that you read this book.
It's about Vietnam. Certainly Vietnam is a boring subject to most of us. Even the President doesn't talk about it much anymore, except to say that the war is ending. Those who loudly support or loudly condemn the war these days are usually eccentrics or fools. For most of the students at Bowdoin the war is over. Draft calls are low; ROTC is a path to grad school rather than to the battle field, and the
chance of any future wars breaking out while Kissinger is in charge seem slight. But something might go wrong. Kissinger might die, or Nixon might be reelected. The enemy might launch a new offensive, or the Defense Department might decide that low draft calls aren't necessary in a non-election year, and some of us could find ourselves faced with the choice of serving in Vietnam or going to jail or to Canada. A reading of Dr. Glasser's book will help you make that choice. Glasser never served in Vietnam, but he did do time in an army hospital in Japan. In 365 days he writes about some of the things he heard and saw in that hospital: the burn cases, the colonel fragged by his own men, the commandos back from secret missions in the North, the legless man who was blown apart by a mine. The legless man is the most interesting case that Dr. Glasser describes, and since most of you won't bother to read the book I've reprinted in in full below.
