@TITLE=CYCLE-RIDING YALE PROF. WILL SPEAK ON UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM 
@BODY=Robert M. Cook, a Yale UniversityProfessor and opponent ofUnited States policy in Vietnam, will speakat Bowdoin March 9.Professor Cook's lecture, "Vietnamand American Foreign Policy â€” A View from the New Left,"will be given at 7:30 p.m. in theSenior Center and is being sponsoredby the Bowdoin PoliticalForum.Professor Cook, an ex-Marineofficer, was defeated in a Congressionalrace last fall in Connecticut'sThird District. He ran asan independent, supported by theAmerican Independent Movement,and campaigned against the warin Vietnam, calling it "wrong."The motorcycle-riding, guitar playingsociology professor has alsobeen active in the civil rightsmovement. He took part in theSelma, Alabama, protest march in 1965and participated in New HavensFreedom School.Only last week Professor Cookannounced he would give all hissociology seminar students at Yalea "satisfactory" grade in whathas been interpreted as objectionto the use of college grades to determinewhether a student shouldbe deferred from military service.Professor Cook uses an historicalapproach in his teaching of sociologyand his interest is in thelong term evolution of Americansociety. He believes that collegesshould strive to close the distancebetween the studies of the classroomand the practical problems ofthe community.
