@TITLE=College Paper asks Johnson be impeached
@BODY=BOSTON - The Boston UniversityNews, an undergraduatedaily, called Thursday for the impeachmentof President Johnsonbecause of the Vietnam war.The newspaper's editorialbrought a quick disclaimer fromthe university administration.President Harold C. Case sentmessages to Speaker John W. Mc-Cormack of Massachusetts and allmembers of the U.S'. House, expressingregrets on the editorial."Under the guise of freedom ofspeech, student editors often writeintemperately," Case said. "Studenteditors enjoy editorial freedomin producing the newspaperIt is unfortunate they do not also reveal a corresponding sense ofresponsibility."The editorial said the editors"believe the action of LyndonBaines Johnson is turning a militaryassistance command into anAmerican war without Congressionaldeclaration and in violationof international accords, and inkilling other human beings by thethousands without even the benefitof a clear case of self defense,are high crimes and warrant hisimpeachment."
