@TITLE=Harmon Deplores Gullibility Of Vietnamese War Opponents
@BODY=Michael Harmon '67, prominentmember of Bowdoin's Young Americansfor Freedom, "criticized in aForum talk Monday recent demonstrationsagainst American involvementin Vietnam here atBowdoin and in New York andSan Francisco last weekend.Unhappy with Orient coverage ofthe war, Harmon referred to thecampus weekly as "the Odious"because of its "shocking pink tint.""In a signed editorial," he said,"the impartial, fairminded editorsstated that the Chairman of theHouse Un-American ActivitiesCommittee made 'witch-huntingstatements,' Thus they demonstratedhow much they dislikeblanket condemnations of anypeace-loving group, and especiallythe notoriously peaceable CommunistParty."The "credibility gap" came underfire next. He claimed thatpeople like Carol Brightman andHarrison Salisbury, who insist onthe credibility gap between thepeople and the President, accept"all that Uncle Ho seems willingto shovel; and he has a really bigshovel." Those who accept Communistpropaganda handouts asobjective fact are doing as muchto deceive the country as are thosewho exaggerate the United States position."After all, we're napalming children aren't we? The New YorkTimes says so does Ramparts. TheBath - Brunswick Times - Recordmakes that claim and so does theDaily Worker. It must be true!True, that is until the medical authorityfor the New York Tonestravels to Vietnam and returns toreport that those burned childrenthat Ramparts was so morally indignantabout were really burnedby gasoline. Of course, Miss Brightmancalled the Doctor a liar becauseafter all she saw what theNorth Vietnamese wanted her tosee, and aren't they objective?
