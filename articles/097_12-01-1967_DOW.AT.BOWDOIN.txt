@TITLE=Dow at Bowdoin
@BODY=The editorial in the last issue of the Orient discussing the
future of ROTC contained the parenthetical thought "Dow
Chemical, the manufacturer of napalm, will be here December
6 and its recruiting should be hindered." This is an unfortunately
clear statement, because a not was intended before "be
hindered."
With this correction, the statement becomes consistent with
the arguments put forward in the editorial for withdrawing
credit from ROTC, but allowing it to remain on campus as an
extracurricular function. We expressed this feeling by stating
that "the values of the military and the college may be in
conflict but not necessarily more in conflict than, for instance,
business and intellectual values."
We reiterate this reasoning in prelude to elaborating exactly
what position should be taken towards the presence of Dow on
campus, without actively interfering with its recruiting activities.
Demonstrations, in the very nature of the word, are the
expression of a viewpoint through basically symbolic means. The
waving of signs, the exchange of opinions, the picket line are
only representations of the actions to be taken or the facts considered
to achieve a change in policy.
Similarly the presence of military recruiters can be interpreted
as a symbol of the military action on Vietnam, and
teach-ins and counter-arguments which are presented alongside
this recruiting are a symbol of the large body of opinion against
the war. 
Because of its "involvement in a particularly gruesome
aspect of the war, the manufacturers of napalm have been
a target of both physical obstruction on other campuses and less
violent objections to the war. As such a symbol, the visit of
Dow to Bowdoin should be an opportunity to reemphasize the
protest against the war felt by a segment of the Bowdoin community.
