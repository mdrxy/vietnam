@TITLE=An Earful of Propaganda
@BODY=We are sure the readers of the Portland Press Harried area sophisticated lot who realize that the paper's editorials arepresented as a special pleader for South Vietnam and its war ofaggression against Hanoi.The Press Harried slants its coverage in favor of the Saigonregime; and while the paper says a correspondent spent six weeksin Southeast Asia, most of it in South Vietnam, there is not theslightest hint the paper's announcement of their correspondent'sreports that he will even suggest the suffering of the north andits people at the hands of American bombers.So -the readers are not going to learn that in 1966, the United Statesbombed, burned dozens of villagers, slew workers and citizens,and carried away thousands more, or that upwards of half of thecasualties witnessed by Carol Brightman of Viet-Report werecaused by anti-personnel weapons.On the understanding that this will be an Administrationpropaganda show, the paper's message should be a diverting one.M.F.R.
