@TITLE=Sons and Daughters: The Berkeley Bag
@BODY=Sons and Daughters, shown in
Sills Hall last Monday night, failed
to leave anyone who saw it unmoved.
Some were angered, some
depressed, some disgusted. Not all
these emotions were directed toward
America's foreign policy in
Southeast Asia. Many directed
such sentiments towards the film
and/or the Berkeley protest movement.
The fi'm has as its focal
point the Berkeley Campus of the
University of California and the
protests there against the Vietnam
War in the spring of 1965.
The film is committed to the
viewpoint that we should not be
there. This is its premise, not
its conclusion.
The answer comes like a scream
at the conscience of those who
accept the premise. You mobilize
everything within your power to
fight the powers that have committed
you to that which you do not
want you or your country committed.
You do this because you
are morally and legally responsible
for what is done in the name
of America. You do this because
this is what is in the best interest
of this country, both in maintaining
respect and power abroad and
the fabric of society at home. This
in a nutshell was what Jerry Stoll
and Stephen Lighthill were saying
with this film.
The message is not: Don't think,
march. But rather, If you think
this way then you should feel a
commitment to act. The film is
sophisticated enough to assume
an audience that has already heard
of Vietnam and has already heard
the issues. If one is aroused, then
the film has met its objective.
The visual content of the film
predominates as the working language.
Action scenes in Vietnam
are not used to illustrate someone's
speech, but rather the speech
adds supporting undercurrent to
the dynamic action on the screen.
Each shot is picked carefully to
fit into short sequences rarely
lasting more than 10 seconds. The
result is a forceful rhythm of sequence
cycles. Each nearly always
ends in some scene of violence
by American soldiers, bombs,
or police, the next cycle often beginning
with the aftermath of violence
or a return to the Berkeley
campus. The rhythms of action
and sound flow throughout the entire
film.
Wide angle vistas of a bombing
squadron are contrasted with dramatic
close-ups of grief stricken
peasants. Telephoto shots are connected
with fast moving pans, giving
us an intimate view - of "Mr.
Apathetic America" dusting his
coat and buying a paper or an
intimate contrast between a radiant
protester singing, "We are
not afraid," and a scared cop
with nervous eyes. S!ow motion
dramatizes violence; stop action
heightens irony. A Hell's Angel is
aggressively attacking the protesters.
He is screaming, "Who the
hell do you think you are! This is
America!" STOP. The Angel is
frozen on the screen, words still
ringing in our minds, irrational
hatred etched in his contorted face.
The film is a fine piece of work
regardless of the political implications.
one does not have to
agree that the Klu Klux Klan
saved the South or that Hitler
could save Germany to see that
Birth of a Nation and Triumph of
the Will are great films. Sons
and Daughters is more sophisticated
and more honest than either
of the above or for that matter
the films put out by the American
Legion or the USIA of our State
Department.
