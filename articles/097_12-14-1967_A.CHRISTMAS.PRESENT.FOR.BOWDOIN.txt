@TITLE=A Christmas Present for Bowdoin
@BODY=With the urgent arguments for exam reform, co-educationcounseling, supporting peace efforts in Vietnam, laughing atGeneral Haershey, telling the FBI to lay off the poor little boysof Bowdoin, little space in the Orient has been devoted to discussingsome of the most pressing and worthwhile needs of theCollege.When, we cry, will the Great Powers that Be realize thatBowdoin students are genuinely disturbed to see their friendsand roommates sink slurpily into the tenacious, albeit fertile,Maine soil? When will students rise up and demand completesatisfaction in this demand for the best possible living conditionsto go along with all the other hard-won reforms of thepast? When will we realize the College's complete responsibilityto provide us with the easiest possible existence, short of abolishinghour exams.In short, when will the faculty and Governing Boards actdecisively to protect poor little boys from the (obscene) vagariesof Maine's climate.As usual, the Orient is quick to offer the simplest (no, wedidn't say simplistic) and most desirable proposal to alleviatethis heretofore unrelieved unhappiness: With the emphasis ondeficit spending which prevades in the country (and College),just think how we can become the only completely EnvironmentallyControlled school in the country: Yes, Bowdoin shouldbuild a $50,000,000 Astro-dome and thus have a true cocoon ofself-gratification for its students.Merry Christmas.
