@TITLE=LETTERS TO THE EDITOR TO CUT WAR SPENDING
@BODY=To The Editor:
It's tragic to watch naive young American boys
being sent to die in South Vietnam, defending
General Ky. Ky and nine of 10 of his generals
fought on the side of the French against their
own people. They are all traitors and tories.
My ancestors were revolutionaries. They fought
against the Tories. Had the word been known at
that time they would have been called communists.
I've always been on the side of the poor against
the rich, of the worker against the exploiter. How
a free and presumably idealistic people can be seduced
into supporting a parasitic hot pilot like Ky
is more than I can comprehend.
A lack of understanding of economics is at the
root of our trouble. How many realize that all our
prosperity since 1929 has been due to war spending.
If peace came tomorrow, our whole economy
would collapse. This is the paramount reason for
prolonging this looney war.
I'd like to debate in public with any professor of
economics who denies this.
I have a very simple solution:
(1) Take our $73 billion war budget and spend
it all upon feeding, housing and clothing the poor
of the world, no matter what their race, religion
or political belief. Start with Mississippi.
(2) Make the Vietnam war democratic. Let it
be fought by volunteers and paid for by voluntary
contributions. You'd find out how a free people
really feel about this ignoble extermination of
poor peasants.
