@TITLE=THE COMMITTEE OF RESPONSIBILITY
@BODY=The Campus Chest Committee's decision to support the Committeeof Responsibility provides an objective means of involvementfor the Bowdoin community in the unfortunate situation inVietnam. Regardless of one's political feelings concerning thejustification of American participation in the war, the unquestionablefact remains that innocent children are becoming thevictims of circumstances they neither comprehend nor deserveThe American people, because of the military activities of theircountry in Vietnam, bear partial responsibility for the needlesssuffering of these young people.The Committee of Responsibility is a non-partisan organization,and one that warrants the support of all conscientiousAmericans.
