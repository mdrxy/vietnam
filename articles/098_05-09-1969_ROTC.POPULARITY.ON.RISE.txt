@TITLE=ROTC Popularity on Rise
@BODY=The student had just walked out of the Moulton Union into the sunshine when a shot rang out and splintered the door to his right. Instinctively, he dove for the cover of the nearby bushes at the same time putting on his Red Cross armband. As a reporter I had heard rumors about increased military activity on the Bowdoin campus, but this was the first incident I had witnessed. As I squatted down next to him a grenade exploded close to us. "Get down, man, or you'll lose your head. This is varsity ROTC practice." "What?" "Varsity ROTC! It's a new sport and during afternoon practice sessions anyone on campus not in uniform is the enemy." "What's the armband for?" I asked. "Shows I'm a stretcher bearer. I get out of cal classes this way and after the first year I get an army-green letter sweater with a bullseye on the back." (World War II booby traps, he explained.) "This sport provides on the job training for those ROTC players who plan to go on to Vietnam. Naturally, an who do, will lose their amateur standing." "We have a war with Amherst this Saturday. If Bowdoin wins, the survivors will fight in the New England Small College playoffs. The finals will be shown on ABC Television's Wide World of War." "All intercollegiate wars are fought under strict ECAC and Geneva Convention rules. Just good clean fighting with conventional weapons. If neither side surrenders after a day or so, the casualty count will decide the winner. We only lost to Trinity last week by two bodies."
