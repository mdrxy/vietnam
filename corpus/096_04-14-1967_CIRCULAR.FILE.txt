@BODY="Sons and Daughters," a documentary-style film on Vietnam,
will be shown on Monday evening (April 17)...The film will be presented at 7:30pm in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall. 
Producers of the feature-length movie said it "records 36 hours
in the life of a community challenged by the impact of an unpopular
war." The film is set in the San Francisco area during protest demonstrations
in October of 1965.
Marc B. Freedman, a member of the Bowdoin chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS), one of the sponsors, said the film
also depicts those Americans who fight in Vietnam and those who
protest against the war.
