@BODY=The following poem was published in the Cleveland
State University Cauldron. Their editors stated
that "although the literary value of the work
may be open to debate, the editors felt that it was
an eloquent expression of their sentiment on the
war in Vietnam, and all war in general. The poem
is printed with the author's permission."
Why should you worry or give a damn
About what happens in Vietnam?
Why is it any of your concern
If men and women and children burn?
Only a pacifist, saint or fool
Believes in stuff like the Golden Rule . . .
You know the answer — you know it Well —
"This is a war and war is hell!"
Yes, war is hell for the men that fight.
Pawns on a chessboard, brown and white:
Mar is death in a sea of mud
To the sound of bullets and stench of blood:
War is madness told as the truth,
Torturing women and crippling youth . . .
But you know the answer - you know it well-
"This is a war and and war is hell!"
Try to project what your thoughts would be
If you left your home as a refugee: -
Try to imagine the sense of fear
When the napalm scatters and flames appear . . .
What kind of feelings would it inspire
If you watched a child with its flesh on fire?
Could you find words for the pilots above
Who boast about morals and Christian love?
War is a gamble played with Fate
Where the stakes are high and the hour is late:
Was is the writing seen on the wall
Which threatens to come and engulf us all' . . .
It's time to worry and time to care,
It's time to pity and time to share;
It's time to consider the Human Race
And see ourselves in the other man's place,
