@TITLE=Dulles Reviews CIA History; Outlines United States Intelligence Net Says Barghoorn Incident Typical of Russian 'Misunderstanding'
@BODY="If you can't separate the wheat from the chaff, the good from the bad, and the honest from the dishonest, they you aren't doing a good job," said Allen Dulles, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency as he spoke to a capacity crowd at Pickard Theater on Wednesday night. 
Dulles wanted to make clear that the C.I.A. being a part of the United States government was a tool for the development of policy and not that of subversion against enemies of the United States. 
CIA From OSS
In trying to show why the Central Intelligence Agency was founded, Dulles felt it necessary to go back to the days of World War II, and the founding of the OSS. At first the Government wanted to stop intelligence work after the war, but three major reasons made high official decide against this action. 
The first was the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Dulles made it clear that the main reason fro the surprise element was not that the United States did not have information about Japanese intentions, but that the information available was not coordinated and submitted to proper authorities. The Army, Navy and the F.B.I. did have a lot of information on the forthcoming Japanese attack, but unfortunately, this information never went beyond these sources. Thus, the defense forces of the Nation were never alerted for an attack and the President did not know of it until after the disaster. 
The second reason was that the United States faced a great deal of disillusionment with the Russian at the Yalta Conference after which they broke almost all of their promises on such things as the occupation of Berlin and the western oriented countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. It was not until 1947 and the Truman Doctrine which Dulles calls "the year of the awakening as to what Communism meant."
Dulles felt that the Truman Doctrine was not enough to stop the tides of Communism. Although the United States was invited by the government of Greece to help in the fight against the Communist guerrillas, it was helpless to fight the communists in a country in which its services were not invited. Thus, by 1947 it was obvious that there were enough international trouble spots which affected the security of the United States that the President had to have information available to him, which would help him In the development of a firm policy in the fight against communists. Tee Difficult... Tee Spread
Mr. Dulles made it clear that the C.I.A. was not the only organization founded for the protection of United States security. The National Defense Act of 1947 set up the National Security Council and the formalizing of the Defense Department. Yet in order for the United States to be able to protect herself beyond her shores the C.I.A. had to be set up because as Dulles said: "Our problems have gotten to difficult and spread out...and thus the C.I.A. would be able to set up security forces in Vietnam and Cuba." In helping to formulate policy Dulles gave four major modes in which the C.I.A. must work. First it must work with the Army, Navy, Air Force, FBI and other agencies coordinating the flow of intelligence when policy is needed. (Often, he said, this information can be 'scare' the President into making an active policy within a few hours.) Secondly, 
the C.I.A. must learn to work In competition with the other intelligence agencies In the government. Dulles felt that a little competition development of policy is good and that of course too much of competition would lead to confusion. Thirdly, the C.I.A. must work in conjunction with the State Department on matters of information. (Mr. Dulles also made it clear that it was not the C.I.A. which made policy but the President and the State Department.)
Fourthly, the C.I.A. has a great deal of work in the field of counter intelligence. He pointed out that many spies are caught as a result of 'long, hard work.' In conjunction with this Dulles stated: "The public should not get alarmed at the fact that we are catching so many spies. For one thing, it shows that we are on our toes and it does diminish the present number of spies that the soviets have in operation." One of the reason that the soviets have so much trouble with their spies, pointed out Dulles, is that they just don't trust them. Soviet spies can't turn in information without documents to prove that they are telling the truth. Thus, many spies are caught in the difficult task of trying to steal government and defense industry documents. 
Barghoon Case cited
Mr. Dulles also commented on the immediate situations. 'Khrushchev basically doesn't understand the United States.' The Barghoorn case proves it. Khrushchev was baffled when the United States made such a fuss over 'one little incident and one person.' Here is a great difference between the Communist and the American way of thinking - they don't care about the individual. The Cuban crisis also pointed out the basic misunderstanding that Khrushchev has of the United States He thought that we would back down, but we of course didn't." 
One of the questions that Mr. Dulles entertained was whether or not the American press gave away too much information for the world to read. "Yes," said Dulles , "The American press is great for spying. I am especially worried about the amount of information published on the National Defense spending. Every one knows exactly what the money is being spent for. We go to so much trouble of getting information and then the press gives it away on us." 
Mr. Dulles is an authority on intelligence procedures and policy making. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton where he also received his Master of Arts in 1928, Dulles started his career as a teacher of English in India. But within a short time of this undertaking, Mr. Dulles began a long career with the United States Foreign Service with assignments in Switzerland, Austria-Hungary (of the old Holy Empire), Germany, Italy and Turkey. Mr. Dulles was also a legal advisor to the American delegation at the Geneva Convention in 1927 for which work he was given the award of Merit and Freedom. During World War II, Dulles was with the OSS and was one of the founders of the hard-core American intelligence system. After the War, he helped to start the Central Intelligence Agency of which he became the Director in 1953.
