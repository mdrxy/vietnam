@TITLE=Bowdoin SDS Undergoes Changes
@BODY=SDS arrived at Bowdoin last October in something less than a blaze of glory. An organizational meeting, attended by perhaps fifty, might best be characterized as an experiment in anarchy. The hostile were left secure, the curious were left hostile, and the sympathetic were left confused. Subsequent meetings drew as many as twenty five and as few as ten. As the organization began to lose its novelty, and October's visions of a Columbia in the pines faded, the hangers-on gave war to a nucleus of about a dozen people committed enough to work. SDS survives at Bowdoin as that committed nucleus. On April 11, I attended the first meeting of the SDS free seminar on radical thought. Although only one person was formally enrolled in the seminar, and he failed to appear, eleven people were present. The scheduled subject for discussion was the book Who Rules America. The three or four people who had read it agreed that it was an interesting book, and the discussion turned to other waters. With the question of ROTC at Bowdoin as a starting point, the issues became progressively broader. The positions represented became increasingly polar, and the amount of communication occurring increasingly less. The situation that evolved was a microcosm of the larger situation both at Bowdoin and in society as a whole. The small group of SDS members present defended the philosophies of the New Left with both skill and fervor; their arguments were knowledgeable, and they rhetoric was polished. For the remained of the group, the differences in commitment were simply too great, however; middle ground, the battlefield, if you wish, had simply ceased to exist. The meeting ended with no one converted, everyone convinced, and everyone frustrated. I remained beyond the end of that meeting to talk to three of the SDS members present. Although they agreed that the seminar had gone badly, they were optimistic about its future. The first point they made is that SDS as it exists at Bowdoin now is fundamentally different than SDS as it existed in October, when it was organized. At that time, it was oriented primarily toward change within the college. In accordance with that philosophy, the organization chose the elimination of social rules as its first issue. This area seemed ideal; social rules were contrary to the basic SDS concept of individual freedom within the institution, and was also the sort of popular issue which it was hoped would attract students to SDS. As a medium for action SDS strategy hinged on a basic miscalculation, however. It proved to be impossible to take a more extreme position than the administration could accept. Almost every effort of the college seemed to be devoted to giving SDS everything it wanted in the most expedient way possible. Put in the uncomfortable position of being victors by coincidence, and of having seemed to create an issue, SDS strategy yielded a negative result. As the social rules issue stagnated, and October's intoxicating visions of a Columbia in the pines faded, SDS membership shrank to about a dozen people committed beyond the issue of convenient coitus. To this remnant, change within the college appeared valid only insofar as it was a means to a greater end, that of radical institutional and conceptual change in American society. SDS conceives of itself of being in the college, but not of it. Thus, the issue of the second generation of SDS is that of ROTC. In summary, the argument is that the basic philosophy and the ideals of the military establishment and the liberal arts college are contradictory. The existence of the ROTC program at Bowdoin is viewed as a symbol of the pervasive and negative influence of the military-industrial complex in American society. By allowing ROTC to remain on campus, it is argued, the college is in effect lending tactic support to such military efforts as Vietnam, which, it is held, is an imperialistic war of oppression. The ROTC issue appeals to SDS on three grounds. First, ROTC is a visible and vulnerable representative of the establishment that SDS deplores; second, it is possible to attract widespread support to the fight against ROTC because of the nearly universal sentiment against Vietnam; and third ROTC in a peculiar sense, shares with SDS the position of being within the college and also of society. A second area in which SDS members have acted is in support of the Bath welfare strike. Two preliminary points are necessary to a discussion of SDS action in this matter: first, that SDS members did no organizational work, and second, that SDS members were involved primarily as individuals rather than as SDS members. The strike was organized by an organization called Help All People Equally,m to combat the government food stamp program. This program required that a certain percentage of every welfare recipient's monthly income be spent on food stamps which he could then use to buy food at substantial savings from retail stores. The program was opposed on two counts. First, that the required percentage of monthly income left the participant with nothing to spend on foods to supplement the basic staples that he was able to buy with stamps, and second, that operating through retail outlets was unnecessarily expensive. The strike was successful; a direct distribution of surplus foods has been substituted. SDS members wrote a statement for HAPE and also helped to supply transportation and babysitting. They attempted during the strike to point out the larger issues that they felt were involved, and at times advised welfare recipients of their legal rights, but ended their involvement at that point. The success of the strike terminated SDS involvement, and they currently have nothing to do with the operation of HAPE. IN the Brunswick community, SDS is also involved with students as Brunswick High School. Students are welcome at Bowdoin SDS meetings, and have attempted to organize protests over high school issue. There is no direct organizational work being done by Bowdoin SDS members in Brunswick High School, nor does an SDS chapter exist there. Because SDS continues to exist as an alliance of similarly concerned individuals, rather than as an organization in some more traditional sense, it is difficult to define it beyond its present activities, and still more difficult to predict its future. One often finds many theses, but little synthesis. Its single most pressing problem remains that of communication; somehow, it must begin to put it all together if it is to broaden its base of operation. The specific problem of the seminar is, in a real sense, the larger problem of the group as a whole; there is no lack of battles, but the organization has yet to find a suitable battlefield.
