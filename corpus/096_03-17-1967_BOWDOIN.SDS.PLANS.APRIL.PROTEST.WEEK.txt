@TITLE=Bowdoin SDS Plans April Protest Week
@BODY=The newly created organization has jarred the campus out of its political apathy.
The Students fora Democratic Society has ralliedenthusiasm among campus liberals,and has undertaken an ambitiousprogram to promote its ideas andprinciples.The SDS has placed itself inactive opposition to the VietnamWar and the Selective Service,according to chairman MarcFreedman. The "new left" organizationcirculated protest literatureagainst the series of SelectiveService Examinations and stationedpickets outside Hubbard Hallon both occasions when the testwas administered. On the 11 ofthis month, the SDS musteredeight picketers to protest the exam.Several Bowdoin members planto participate in the State of Maine Peace Conference, scheduled for March, 19 at Bates Bates college Registration begins ata.m. in Room 109 of the CarnegieScience Building. Students, members of the clergy, supporters ofpeace candidate Thomas Maynardand interested citizens will be attending.The proposed conferenceis the product of the University ofMaine SDS chapter. The peaceconference, however, is not labeleda purely SDS function.The campus organization will beplaying a major State role in theupcoming national protest weekextending from April 8 to 15. Presently, in the tentative stages of development, are plans for an April12 teach-in at Wentworth Hall ofthe Senior Center. Concrete proposals will be forthcoming afterspring vacation.
