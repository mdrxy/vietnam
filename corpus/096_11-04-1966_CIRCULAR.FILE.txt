@BODY=A show of paintings by well-known Maine artist Gene Kiebe opened in the Gallery Lounge of the Union Tuesday and will run through the months of November and December. The show includes some 16 to 20 paintings in water color and oil by Mr. Kiebe, a native of Philadelphia who has made his home in Bristol, Maine, for the last 22 years. More than half of the painting will be marines and each will represent the Maine scene. All the paintings in the show were done in the past few years. Mr. Kiebe recently returned from an assignment given him by the U.S Navy to record the launch and recovery of the record-breaking Gemini Xi space flight for the Navy Art Collection. His assignment now is to do three official paintings of the event. A recent feature article in the Portland, Maine, Sunday Telegram reproduced some of Mr. Kiebe's sketches of the recovery and also paintings he did as a Navy Combat Artist in Vietnam in 1965. His assignment during that period was to gather material for a series of paintings showing the role of the Navy and the Marines in the war. Mr. Kiebe is currently engaged in painting the murals for the State of Maine Building in Expo 67, the Canadian World's Far, opening next spring in Montreal.
