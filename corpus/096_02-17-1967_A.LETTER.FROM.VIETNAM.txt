@TITLE=A LETTER FROM VIETNAM
@BODY=To The Editor:I recently received a letter from a servicemanin, Vietnam asking for my help.The Vietnam War drags on presently, exactinga specific personal sacrifice from our servicemen.Regardless of whether we ought to be there, thenightmare reality is that we are there—and I hopewe unanimously sympathize with the servicemenwho are involved in the struggle.Invariably performing their duty without question,these men cannot enjoy the luxury of askingwhy we are there, nor protest the war throughthe various fashionable forms of civil disobedience.These men are there. And whether right or not,whether we. stand behind the war or not, surelywe must stand behind the men who are carryingout the instructions of the national government.Whether we are in reality protecting the rightto self-determination, in this or any other freesociety, it is likely that our servicemen believethat we are, and are fighting for just that belief.And they deserve some tangible appreciation.Along with the sometime quiet, sometime heroicsacrifices of our servicemen, I simultaneously witnessthe statement of a student at the nearbyUniversity of New Hampshire, President of theStudents for a Democratic Society there. He counsels:"The most important thing for a studenttoday is to question the government" »Brilliant.Instead, I ask that the students and alumni ofBowdoin write a letter to a serviceman in Vietnam,one of who has written me:"Several of the boys do not have anyone towrite to and it gets pretty lonesome out herewithout mail. . . . Anyone who would like to writea serviceman can forward all letters to me and Iwill distribute them as they arrive. You have noidea how much this will mean to them."(Signed)Maynard Sargent, S.N.VAW-11 Detachment MIKEUSS Enterprise CVAN 65FPO San Francisco,California 96601James A.
