@TITLE=Sigma Nu Alumnus Comments
@BODY=Dear sir: Attached is copy of our letter of March 5, 1962. We are informed by the press, the Boston Herald of October 14, 1966, that the Bowdoin faculty has asked the governing boards to ban Sigma Nu from the campus. The United States government at Washington has duly acquired the reputation of being the world's biggest BUSYBODY, meddling in the domestic affairs of other nations, to wit, Vietnam, 10000 miles from Brunswick, Maine. Now the Bowdoin faculty has taken on the job of being a National  busybody, telling a National Fraternity with national headquarters at Lexington, Virginia, how to run its business. There are over 700 Bowdoin alumni who are Sigma Nu, and we do not like it. The faculty should educate the boys and mind its own business. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan, have excellent academic standards; and yet field good football teams. Cannot Bowdoin do the same? Look at the record this fall: I would speculate that 90% of the faculty are immigrants from other colleges. We need men of wisdom like Casey Sills and Dean Nixon. It is hoped that the Governing Boards of Bowdoin have the wisdom and vision to vote against the faculty recommendation in the matter of Sigma Nu. If you divide the Alumni is will affect the Alumni Fund.
