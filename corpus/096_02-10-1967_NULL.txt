@BODY=Bowdoin ROTC cadets will get insight into Vietnam, its people and terrain, through film taken by an Army Veteran who returned last fall from that war-torn country. 
The film footage, taken by Sgt. Maj. Joseph R. P. Daly during his tour of duty in 1966, shows prominent terrain features of the country side, together with scenes of cities and towns and the daily activities of the people. 
It is designed as a special feature of a sophomore map reading course
and will aid cadets in understanding the course, said Sergeant Daly, who
is Detachment Sergeant Major of the ROTC Instructor Group at Bowdoin. 
Sergeant Daly said he plans to supplement his regular 15-hour map reading course with about 4,000 feet of film. The course begins with the opening of the spring semester Wednesday (Feb. 1).
